# Heart Attack Data Analysis and Prediction (Classification Project)

A heart attack, medically known as a myocardial infarction, is a serious and potentially life-threatening event that occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. This blockage is often the result of a clot obstructing the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. When the heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen, it can become damaged or start to die, leading to a heart attack.

If someone can identify heart attack early, there is a significant change him/her to get medical attention and survive from the danger.

### Project goal
In this project I will develop a classification model for predicting the chance someone gets a hear attack based on the data provided in the dataset.

### Data source and Data description
I will be using [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?select=heart.csv) from Kaggle.

### Technologies and Tools
1. I have fitted **Logistic regression**, **Decision Tree Classifier**,  **Support Vector Machine Classifier**, and **RandomForest Classifier** algorithm for this project.
2. LabelEncoder and OnehotEncorder
3. Pipeline
4. GridSearchCV for parameter tuning
5. Matplotlib and Seaborn as the graphing libraries
